Object Detection With Deep Learning On Raspberry Pi
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# First Milestone
  
So far I was able to get tensorflow working on my raspberry pi, which is a platform/tool that is made for machine learning. After getting tensorflow installed, I was able to test it out twice and it worked perfectly both times. First, I tested it with a given set of code found online and for the second test I uploaded an image and then tweaked the code in order to run this new image. The test results were completely as expected and basically gave an output of how certain the program is on what objects are in the given image. One challange I faced so far was when the code from the github didn't work completely, so to fix this issue I had to change a few lines and files which ended up working how I wanted it to. Since this first crucial step is now completed, the next step is to gather research and test materials for the main project of identifying airlines from images of planes!
